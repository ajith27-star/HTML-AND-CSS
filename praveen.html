    <h1>MOONS</h1>
    <h2>JUPITER</h2>
    <P><A href="https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/moons/">JUPITER</A> has 95 moons that <A>HAVE</A> been officially recognized by the International Astronomical Union. But the number doesn't capture the complexity of the Jovian system of <A>MOONS</A>, rings and asteroids. The giant planet has thousands of small objects in its orbit. Scientists are getting  good<A>GOOD</A> at spotting tiny moons orbiting distant, giant planets that the International Astronomical Union has decided the smallest will no longer be given mythological names unless they are of “significant” scientific <A>INTEREST</A></P>

     <H2>VENUS</H2>
      <P><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/venus/">VENUS</a> is a cloud-swaddled <A>PLANET</A> named for a love goddess, and often called Earth’s twin. But pull up a bit closer, and Venus turns <A>HELLISH</A>. Our nearest planetary neighbor, the second planet from the Sun, has a surface hot enough to melt lead. The atmosphere is so thick that, from the surface, the <A>SUN</A> is just a smear of light.In some ways it is more an opposite of Earth than a twin: Venus spins backward, has a day longer than its year, and lacks any semblance of seasons. It might once have been a habitable ocean world, like Earth, but that was at least a billion years ago. A runaway greenhouse effect turned all surface water into vapor, which then leaked slowly into <A>SPACE</A></P>

        <H2>MERCURY</H2>
        <P><A href="https://science.nasa.gov/mercury/">MERCURY</A>—the smallest <A>PLANET</A> in our solar system and nearest to the Sun—is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact craters. From the <A>SURFACE OF MERCURY</A>, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as 11 times brighter.Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system— that title belongs to <A>NEARBY VENUS</A>, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days. Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient <A>ROMAN GODS</A></P>
